# Practice Midmod Assessment

This is an example of a Midmod Assessment for Turing's Back End Module 1 students to reference and practice.

## Assessment Format

The Mid Mod will follow the same format as other ICâ€™s throughout the mod.

For the Mid Mod, no tests will be provided. You will be expected to TDD all work (which means creating all _spec.rb files and corresponding .rb files).

The code provided in the `lib` and `spec` directory is an example of the code a student would build for a passing paired assessment for *Groomer* and *Day Care*. We strongly recommend working through the practice assessment on your first before checking your work against the example. And remember, the example code is just ONE WAY to solve the problem.
